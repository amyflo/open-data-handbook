        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, fairness has emerged as a matter of serious
          concern within machine learning. There is growing recognition that
          even models developed with the best of intentions may exhibit
          discriminatory biases, perpetuate inequality, or perform less well for
          historically disadvantaged groups. Considerable work is already
          underway within and outside machine learning to both characterize and
          address these problems. This tutorial will take a novel approach to
          parsing the topic, adopting three perspectives: statistics, causality,
          and measurement. Each viewpoint will shed light on different facets of
          the problem and help explain matters of continuing technical and
          normative debate. Rather than attempting to resolve questions of
          fairness within a single technical framework, the tutorial aims to
          equip the audience with a coherent toolkit to critically examine the
          many ways that machine learning implicates fairness.
