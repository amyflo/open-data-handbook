        <h3><b>4.1 </b>Principles</h3>
        <p>Data governance is an institutional framework that promotes accountable and ethical &ldquo;planning,
          oversight, and control over the management of data and the use of data and data-related sources&rdquo; (<a
            href="https://www.cio.com/article/3521011/what-is-data-governance-a-best-practices-framework-for-managing-data-assets.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAMA</a>).
          <mark>Simply put, strong data governance fosters accountability and ethics in management and use of
            data</mark>. It establishes mutual trust within the community your open data portal serves, and mitigates
          potential harms to individuals and populations.

        <p>
        <div class="keyidea-container">
          <p class="keyidea">KEY IDEA</p>
          It is the responsibility of your open data group to collect and publish data in a way that protects privacy,
          prevents misuse and misinterpretation, and builds community trust.
        </div>
        While data can be a powerful tool for understanding the impact and efficiency of the many functions of a
        university, making university data public can pose <a

          target="_blank" rel="noopener">many risks</a>, such as revealing information about students, communities, and
        groups. For example, your group might publish a dataset of the racial distribution for each department over
        time, but if the dataset breaks down the university&rsquo;s Chemistry Department by Gender, Race, and Tenure
        status, you may be able to identify individuals in the dataset (DataSF 2).&nbsp;</p>

      <section id="4.2">
        <h3><b>4.2 </b>Opening Data Responsibly</h3>
        <p>Through a holistic approach, an open data group must publish data responsibly. Below are some questions to
          consider. Skip to the <a href="#4.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Data Governance Protocol'</a> section for

        <h3><b>4.3 </b>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>An open data group can consider themselves as the &lsquo;gatekeepers&rsquo; of the open data portal. We
          believe that no one person should have this important responsibility; rather the entire group should work with
          the administration to create effective and ethical data governance. Having a diverse team is critical to data
          governance â€“ people with different backgrounds contribute different and important perspectives on the harms
          and benefits of a dataset.&nbsp;</p>

          <h4><b>4.4.1 </b>Dataset Collection</h4>
          <p>Responsible data governance starts at dataset acquisition. After all, an open data portal team must collect
            the necessary information to (1) assess and contextualize the dataset properly, and (2) present the dataset
            with the appropriate context and description. Although there are different channels to acquire datasets, we
            have created a standardized approach to this important step in the process. Below are important fields to
            have when creating a &lsquo;Dataset Upload&rsquo; form.</p>

          <h4><b>4.4.2 </b>Dataset Assessment</h4>
          <p>Posting a dataset on your portal gives it an appearance of statistical legitimacy to the public, so your
            open data group should assess the quality of a dataset before posting. A dataset may only capture a part of
            the true data, the data collection may be biased, and it can be difficult to assess this bias using a single
            dataset. For example, if deciding whether to publish a dataset about sexual violence, it would important to
            note that sexual assault data is historically under-documented on college campuses. We discuss an approach
            to approximating data quality in the <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hiM6Hl8I116pgg1Qw7fmKQk4qTE0rwsfh7ikzxC07c/edit#bookmark=id.wib7q6aseyan"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lsquo;Data Governance Protocol&rsquo;</a> section.</p>
          <p>Next, you must holistically evaluate the utility and risks of publishing the dataset. Teams may not
            understand all the factors at play so we recommend opening constructive channels for dialogue with the
            administration and/or uploader of the data.</p>
          <p>First, the group must assess the benefits of publishing the dataset. While individual datasets can serve
            specific purposes, publishing datasets more broadly can achieve important goals for universities such as
            increasing student trust in the administration, inspiring new products and ideas, simplifying data requests,
            and enabling data sharing across the administration.</p>

              that can frame and quantify the perceived utility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Second, the group must assess the risk of publishing the dataset. Risks often include privacy concerns,
            potential misuse and misrepresentation of data, bias, and consent to name a few. It is important to remember
            that &ldquo;risk can be managed, but will not be zero&rdquo; (Open Data Release Toolkit). Below are some
            risks to think about and, again, skip to the <a

            <button class="accordion">Consent</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Consent is a bedrock principle of data collection and analysis. In general, before adding a dataset to
                your portal, you should:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Obtain consent for the collection of data, or ensure that consent was obtained before its collection

              <p>With public data, malignant actors may try to use data in nefarious ways. To prevent this, some
                strategies include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Identify vulnerable datasets, including datasets that are composed of individual-level information

              </ul>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Unintentional Misuse</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Many individuals who are interested in this data may have limited experience working with data. As a
                result, even with the best of intentions, data may be misconstrued or used harmfully.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Present the data without personally identifiable information</li>
                <li>Consider adding minor obstacles to access sensitive data &mdash; logins, access requests, and data
                  ethics training are possible options for a healthier balance between benefits and risks.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Misrepresentation</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>It&rsquo;s easy to misrepresent your datasets. As popularized by Mark Twain, &ldquo;There are three
                kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&rdquo; Here are a few strategies to reduce these
                errors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Describe datasets clearly! Explain who collected the information, when it was collected, and how
                  they did it.</li>
                <li>Clarify confusing entries in a dataset (e.g. outliers) by providing context if it exists</li>
                <li>Clarify confusing variables by providing definitions and example interpretations&nbsp;</li>
                <li>If there are sanity checks embedded (e.g. every row adds to a certain number), make sure to mention
                  those.</li>
                <li>How did selection bias factor into the dataset? As the Human Rights Data Analysis Group <a
                    href="https://hrdag.org/data-publication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts it</a>, &ldquo;Data
                  collected by what we can observe is what statisticians call a convenience sample, which is subject to
                  selection bias.&rdquo; To help minimize this risk, make sure to specify where and why your sample may
                  be unrepresentative. Also remember that data might be missing to conceal information, possibly with
                  malicious intent.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Bias and Equity</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Data may perpetuate inequities in society. Here are a few questions to think about:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Who collected the data?</li>
                <li>Who was the data collected from? Were certain groups over- or under-represented?</li>
                <li>What questions were asked and how were they framed?&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Can this dataset be used to perpetuate dangerous stereotypes or decisions? For example, a dataset
                  that shows grades based on race or gender should be treated very carefully.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Third, the group must decide whether any of the risks can be mitigated through de-identification.
            De-identification refers to a collection of processes that prevent personal information from being revealed.
            However, the process may render a dataset useless for the public because de-identification could remove the
            context and meaning of a dataset. For most datasets, we recommend following <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_K59q9ik5eEw9_-iiPCbQ8WSlGk0FovNz1uLajVHoi0/edit"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khaled El Emam&rsquo;s De-Identification Protocol for Open Data</a>,
            clearly labeled on pages 15 and 25 of DataSF&rsquo;s Open Data Release Toolkit. In some cases, it might be a
            good idea to consider other methods such as <a
              href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">differential privacy</a>.</p>
          <p>Lastly, use the risk and utility assessments to create an overall risk-utility score. We have put together

        <ul>
          <li>Have discussions with the resident expert/data steward about updating the dataset</li>
          <li>Maintain good relationships with all data stakeholders by having conversations with community members that
            could be impacted by the dataset. To paraphrase a popular slogan, &ldquo;No data about [a stakeholder]
            without [a stakeholder]&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Understand and document risks and utility after the dataset has been published and incorporate the
            knowledge into future data governance guidelines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>4.6 </b>Data Governance Protocol</h3>
        <p>We have put together a step-by-step process for assessing a dataset. The protocol has been reviewed by the
          Northwestern Data Governance group. The framework serves as both a checklist and a conversation-starter. The
          open data group should work to mitigate the risks and amplify the benefits of releasing a dataset. In most
          cases, the protocol will be used for datasets that are not already public but it can definitely still be
          applied to existing public datasets. It would be best to have conversations with the university
          administration, especially in determining the risk score, because they will have valuable information that
          most students would not know about. A dataset may unilaterally be considered 'un-publishable' by the
          administration even if it passes the process. Lastly, remember the is <span
            style="font-style: italic;">guidance</span>, not a hard-and-fast rule. The weights and questions are based
          on our own experiences, discussions amongst ourselves, and discussions with experts in the field. Feel free to
          adjust the weights and questions based on your group&rsquo;s and university&rsquo;s needs.</p>
        <p>Ask questions about what types of analysis are valid to conduct, the representativeness of the dataset, the
          completeness of the dataset, whether the dataset was the submitter&rsquo;s to share, etc. Meanwhile, we
          believe that administrative data should be more open to the public, as it is often the source by which
          university decisions are made; this makes it important for the public to be able to find biases and errors in
          the dataset. We have provided a simple matrix to determine if a dataset is okay to publish based on the source
          and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
