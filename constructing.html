        <h1>Chapter 2: Constructing a Vision</h1>
        <h2>We discuss how an open data portal can operate within the broader campus community, and how to start
          building a team to start the process.</h2>
      </div>
      <section id="2.1">
        <h3><b>2.1</b> Community Impact</h3>
        <p>This section discusses some strategies to identify the community impact, both the benefits and risks, of an
          open data portal.</p>
        <p> We have found that many universities’ data ecosystems are complicated to navigate — <mark>datasets are hard
            to find and there is a lack of knowledge as to which datasets even exist.</mark> In addition, most of these
          datasets only exist in a PDF format, which disincentivizes and, to some extent, prevents curious community
          members from analyzing or visualizing the data. For example, every year US universities publish a Common
          Dataset in line with federal law with data on enrollment, student characteristics, finances, and more. The
          yearly nature of this data makes it prime for historical analysis — but the fact that the data is in PDF
          format and isn’t connected to previous years makes it difficult for community members to embark on an
          analysis.</p>
        <p><b>Here are several key stakeholders who would benefit from easier access to university data:</b></p>

        <div class="accordion-container">
          <button class="accordion">Students</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Open data can aid journalistic efforts; improve understanding of the community; and fuel projects for
              journalists, civic-minded students, student-body leaders, student groups, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Northwestern University, a group of students used datasets on Northwestern University Police field
              stops, case distribution, and traffic stops found on the Northwestern Open Data Initiative to <a
                href="https://medium.com/@rshuks/a-data-driven-investigation-into-the-northwestern-police-department-62eeaa9efe3a">document
                anti-Blackness in the Northwestern University Police Department.</a>
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Faculty, Staff, and Researchers</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Open data can help with targeted campus improvements and aid ongoing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Stanford Open Data Portal assembled and hosted a regularly updated COVID-19 dataset with case counts,
              deaths, and other relevant statistics from 12 Bay Area counties. The dataset was used by researchers
              throughout the Bay Area who were analyzing the virus’s spread.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Classes and Clubs</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Open data can be integrated into design, engineering, and analytics classes/clubs to promote data
              literacy among the student body.</p>
            <p>The Stanford Open Data Portal worked with the student government and campus newspaper to administer the
              Stanford Community Survey, which included questions related to socioeconomic status.
              It is in the process of being opened.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="keyidea-container">
          <p class="keyidea">KEY IDEA</p>
          When used appropriately, open data can help empower members of marginalized communities, providing more tools
          to demonstrate how campus organizations directly or indirectly harm marginalized communities.
        </div>
        <p>To do this successfully, it is important to include a broad and diverse set of communities in the
          need-finding and data governance processes to make better decisions about which datasets to prioritize
          acquiring, as well as how to work with the data. Additionally, proactive attention on empowering marginalized
          communities will help you identify datasets that should exist, and set you up to work with the relevant
          entities to locate, obtain, or create these datasets.
          <br><br>
          Finally, in building the product, identify a targeted set of potential users. Ideally, they will be invested
          in the final product and can contribute to the development with ideas, user feedback, and testing. When
          building a community-facing product, it is important to involve potential users in the development process.
          <br><br>
          Open data can be powerful, but it also comes with risks. Refer to the <a href="governance.html">Data
            Governance</a> section for a comprehensive breakdown of challenges and how to mitigate them.

        <h3><b>2.2</b> Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>
          <mark>Having an organizational mission statement is useful to align high-level goals, promote an
            organizational culture, and portray external legitimacy.</mark>
          <b>Here are some goals to consider:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Transparency: University operations should be broadly accessible for the campus community it serves.</li>
          <li>Engagement: Members of the campus should be empowered with information to be involved in the broader
            campus community.</li>
          <li>Accountability: Open data can ensure accountability from universities to act in the best interests of
            their community members.</li>
          <li>Build: Open data organizations provide valuable experience to their members in building useful
            public-facing tools.</li>
          <li>Educate: Open data organizations can benefit their members and the broader community educationally by
            increasing data-related skill sets and awareness for builders and the broader community.</li>

      <section id="2.3">
        <h3><b>2.3</b> Team</h3>
        Given the understanding that finding any peers with the time and motivation to take on a new project is a
        difficult task, here are some rough guidelines on expertise and considerations that we found useful. We expect
        individuals to fill multiple roles at the start of the project.
        <b>Important skills to seek out:</b>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Product: Motivated by understanding the community’s open data needs, creating the vision, and shaping the
            team’s work to align with these high-level goals.</li>
          <li>Backend: Building out the infrastructure for hosting and managing data is essential for success.</li>
          <li>Frontend: The representation of data on your portal is the difference between “open data” and “available
            data.”</li>
          <li>Outreach: A technical platform is useless without the data to showcase. Work within members of your
            community to gain access to that data, and maintain those relationships.</li>
          <li>Data Governance: It is important to understand the data landscape and foster relationships with key
            members in the university’s data governance structure.</li>
          <li>User Experience: A major downfall for many existing data portals is the complexity in their interfaces.
            Working with users and catering the experience to real applications of your platform allows your data to
            become accessible.</li>
          <li>Journalism / Data Visualization: Beyond the data itself, analysis is a strong component of your platform.
            Keeping these users in mind will continue to advise your structural decisions.</li>
          <li>Operations: As you expand your team, keeping track of all of the moving parts will become increasingly
            difficult. It’s worth having someone to help manage these growing pains.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Remember that you’re working with data, organizations, and people that represent a diverse set of
          backgrounds.</b>
        <div class="keyidea-container">
          <p class="keyidea">KEY IDEA</p>
          Building a team that represents the diversity of the student body (e.g. by race, gender, socioeconomic status,
          etc.) isn’t just the right thing to do, but it also provides you with valuable perspectives from different
          parts of campus.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="2.4">
        <h3><b>2.4</b> Motivating the Team</h3>
        <p>Building a passionate, sustainable team isn’t easy—think about how you’ll keep everyone excited and engaged
          for the long haul. You may be motivated by the mission of opening data at your university, a desire to build a
          widely used product, or learning skills. Of course, many teammates will be encouraged, at least in part, by
          external motivators. These may include grades, academic credit, recognition, and resume items—and they’re all
          valid reasons for undertaking a new endeavor in college.<br><br>
          If you have students motivated by grades and academic credit, consider seeking to complete the project as part
          of an “independent study.” For students motivated by recognition and resume items, consider applying for an
          incubator program. Additionally, titles like “Head of Product” cost nothing to dole out and are perfect for a
          resume!<br><br>
          Finally, these incentives often have the added benefit of imposing deadlines for the team. As a result, this
          provides another valuable motivation to help bring the project to fruition. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="2.5">
        <h3><b>2.5</b> Lessons from Other Initiatives</h3>
        <p>
          The data ecosystem at your university can be complex. You should learn how faculty and student groups like
          your school newspaper currently access, store, and analyze data.
          <br><br>
          In addition to understanding the landscape at your own school, utilize what has already been done in order to
          showcase the capabilities of university open data portals (see case studies). Not only will this go a long way
          to show the feasibility of your project, but it will also aid in demonstrating the positive impact an open
          data portal has brought in other university settings.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="2.6">
        <h3><b>2.6</b> Finding a Faculty Advisor</h3>
        <p>
          Any project with faculty endorsement gains instant credibility with the administration that you will
          inevitably be in contact with. <mark>The more time you put into choosing the right faculty member and
            facilitating your relationship with them, the better you can leverage that relationship into propelling your
            project forward.</mark>
          <br>
        <div class="keyidea-container">
          <p class="keyidea">KEY IDEA</p>
          The right faculty member should have a background in technology and advocate for public interest in
          technology. Beyond interest and experience, your faculty advisor’s greatest asset will be their administrative
          network.
        </div>
        Make sure that they at least have the time to make the right introductions for you and your team. Moreover,
        being able to show your ability and drive to see this project through is an important factor in your ability to
        mobilize your faculty advisor.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="2.7">
        <h3><b>2.7</b> Key Data Sources</h3>
        <p>
          An open data portal relies on aggregating large quantities of existing data that community members find
          useful. Obtaining such data requires partnerships with data stewards or owners on a university campus. <mark>
            It is important to identify and reach out to such stakeholders early in order to ensure wide usage of your
            portal. </mark> Typical stakeholders include the institutional research office, campus newspaper, police
          department, office of alcohol policy, registrar’s office, public health department, student government, campus
          housing, athletic department, admissions office, campus organizations, IT office, libraries, and data
          governance office.
          <br><br>
          To successfully collect datasets, you should be prepared to answer questions about your data portal such as
          use cases, risk mitigation, and data governance. Your level of data access can vary depending on the source;
          some may already have infrastructure in place to access their data while others may need you to aggregate the
          data on your own.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="2.8">
        <h3><b>2.8</b> Slide Deck</h3>
        <p>
          Prepare a slide deck that explains the aspects of your vision discussed in this section. Remember your target
          audience, which can include administration, other data partners, funding sources, and new recruits. As such,
          it would help to have either modular slide decks or multiple versions.
