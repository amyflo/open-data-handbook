            >
            The concept of open data is predicated on the belief that openness
            fosters desirable outcomes. Too often, information is locked behind
            passwords, hidden within antiquated systems, or trapped in PDFs.
            <mark
              >Opening up these data would empower community stakeholders to
              advocate for transparency, public engagement, and accountability

            At the national level,
            <b
              >Title II of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act
              of 2018</b
            >
            mandated the creation of
            <a href="https://www.data.gov/open-gov/">Data.gov.</a> Since then,
            federal agencies have been required to publish certain information
            as open data, utilizing standard machine-readable data formats with
            metadata stored in Data.gov. The government has also established
            <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/principles/"
              >principles</a
            >
            for <em>open data</em>, which outline that data should be public,
            accessible, documented, reusable, complete, timely, and managed
            post-release. These guidelines form the backdrop for the ideas and
            recommendations throughout this guide.

          <p>
            Like many government entities, universities are
            <b>vital social institutions and stewards of public funds.</b>
            Universities are also committed to the open sharing of ideas and to
            educating the next generation of innovators, researchers, and public
            leaders. These roles of the university motivate the principles of
            transparency, public engagement, and accountability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, data about universities — such as information on
            finances, student life, and academics — is often unavailable to the
            public, locked within opaque university websites, or stored in
            unstructured formats. Our interviews with student journalists,
            campus organizations, and university faculty revealed that
            <mark
              >easy data access shapes the types of stories that are told and
              analyses that are conducted, and every additional hurdle to data
              access increases the cost of discovering information.</mark
            >
            While some universities have begun addressing these hurdles, we have
            noticed a lack of resources that exist to support open data
            standards and initiatives at universities.

            The purpose of this guide is to support the creation of successful
            open data organizations on college campuses. We hope you use this
            document as a set of suggestions for leading open data efforts on
            your own campus.
          </div>

          <p>
            Our insights and recommendations are informed by our experiences
            leading open data efforts at
            <a href="https://stanfordopendata.org/">Stanford University</a> and
            <a href="http://nodi.nu">Northwestern University</a>, as well as
            extensive input from the leaders of numerous campus organizations,
            open data initiatives, and civic tech initiatives across the
            country. However, because this guide is grounded in our personal
            experiences at our respective institutions,
            <mark
              >we hope you will use these insights as a starting point to adapt
              within your own community.</mark
            >
            Additionally, we include a section on
            <a href="governance.html">data governance</a>, an institutional
            framework that promotes accountable and ethical “planning,
            oversight, and control of [data management, data usage, and
            data-related sources]”, that is contextualized for universities (<a
              href="https://www.cio.com/article/3521011/what-is-data-governance-a-best-practices-framework-for-managing-data-assets.html"
              >DAMA</a
            >).
          </p>

          <p>
            The sections are roughly ordered in the sequence we feel you should
            think about each topic. As you build your data portal, we hope that
            this guide can serve as a reference and a guide as you navigate the
            many obstacles incurred as you start your own open data portal.
